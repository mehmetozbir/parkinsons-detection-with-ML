# ðŸ§  Parkinson's Disease Prediction using Voice Biometrics

This project aims to **predict the severity of Parkinson's disease** based on voice measurements using machine learning and explainable AI methods.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To build a predictive model that estimates:
- `motor_UPDRS` score
- `total_UPDRS` score

...using biomedical voice features collected from patients.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Source**: Parkinson's Telemonitoring dataset
- **Samples**: 5,875 voice recordings from 42 patients
- **Features**: 16 biomedical voice measurements (e.g., jitter, shimmer, HNR)

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- SHAP (Explainable AI)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

 ## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Access

The dataset used in this project is **not included in this repository** due to file size or licensing limitations.

You can download the dataset directly from the official UCI Machine Learning Repository:

ðŸ”— [Parkinson's Telemonitoring Dataset â€“ UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/189/parkinsons+telemonitoring)

After downloading, place the following files into the root of this project folder:
- `parkinsons_updrs.data.csv`
- `parkinsons_updrs.names.csv`

Make sure that your notebook reads the file using the correct path:
```python
df = pd.read_csv("parkinsons_updrs.data.csv", names=column_names, header=None)


## ðŸ¤– Model

- **Random Forest Regressor**
- Evaluation metrics: MAE, RMSE, RÂ²
- Feature importance via **SHAP values**
